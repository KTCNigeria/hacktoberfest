# Hacktoberfest 2024 üéÉüçÇ

## About Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is an annual event that takes place from October 1st to 31st. It encourages developers from all backgrounds to contribute to open source projects, learn new skills, and earn rewards.

## Guidelines for Participating in Hacktoberfest (What to Do)
1. **Search for a repository to contribute to**: Find an open-source project on GitHub or GitLab that you are interested in. You can search for issues labeled with `hacktoberfest` or `good-first-issue` to start contributing easily.
2. **Fork the repository**: Fork the repository to create a copy of it under your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.
3. **Clone the repository to your local machine**: Run the following command to clone the forked repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
4. **Create a new branch**: Always create a new branch to work on a feature or fix. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch-name
   ```
5. **Make your changes**: Contribute by fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or any other way you can help.
6. **Commit your changes**: Once you've made the changes, commit them with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add detailed description of changes"
   ```
7. **Push your changes to your forked repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```
8. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: After pushing your changes, open the original repository and create a Pull Request. Make sure to add a detailed description of the changes you've made and reference any relevant issues.

## What to Avoid
- Don't make spammy or low-quality contributions. Hacktoberfest encourages quality contributions that genuinely help open-source projects.
- Avoid creating PRs that only fix typos or make small, unnecessary changes unless they are meaningful.
- Be respectful of project maintainers and follow their contribution guidelines.

## After Submission
- Your pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainers. If accepted, your contributions will count towards your Hacktoberfest goals.
- Make sure to track your progress on the official [Hacktoberfest site](https://hacktoberfest.com).

Happy Hacking! üéâ
