### Set up a GitHub account

1. **Go to GitHub**: Open your browser and navigate to [github.com](https://github.com).
   
2. **Sign up**: Click on the "Sign up" button in the top right corner. You‚Äôll need to provide your email address, create a password, and choose a username. Once you‚Äôve entered these details, click "Create account."

3. **Verify your email**: After creating your account, GitHub will send a verification email to the email address you used. Open the email and click on the verification link.

5. **Explore GitHub**: After setting up your profile, take some time to explore GitHub. You can check out repositories, star your favorite projects, or follow other developers. You‚Äôre now ready to contribute to open source projects!


Once your GitHub account is set up, you can follow the steps in the guidelines provided to participate in Hacktoberfest!
For starters
## Guidelines for Participating in Hacktoberfest (What to Do)
1. **Search for a repository to contribute to**: Find an open-source project on GitHub or GitLab that you are interested in. You can search for issues labeled with `hacktoberfest` or `good-first-issue` to start contributing easily.
2. **Fork the repository**: Fork the repository to create a copy of it under your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.
3. **Clone the repository to your local machine**: Run the following command to clone the forked repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
4. **Create a new branch**: Always create a new branch to work on a feature or fix. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch-name
   ```
5. **Make your changes**: Contribute by fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or any other way you can help.
6. **Commit your changes**: Once you've made the changes, commit them with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add detailed description of changes"
   ```
7. **Push your changes to your forked repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```
8. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: After pushing your changes, open the original repository and create a Pull Request. Make sure to add a detailed description of the changes you've made and reference any relevant issues.

## What to Avoid
- Don't make spammy or low-quality contributions. Hacktoberfest encourages quality contributions that genuinely help open-source projects.
- Avoid creating PRs that only fix typos or make small, unnecessary changes unless they are meaningful.
- Be respectful of project maintainers and follow their contribution guidelines.

## After Submission
- Your pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainers. If accepted, your contributions will count towards your Hacktoberfest goals.
- Make sure to track your progress on the official [Hacktoberfest site](https://hacktoberfest.com).

Happy Hacking! üéâ
